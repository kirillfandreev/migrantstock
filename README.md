# International Migrant Stocks at a Glance Application: migrantstock.shinyapps.io/migrantstock
### Version 13 April 2025

A web application to compare and visualize data on migrant stocks from various sources. The app focuses on comparing trends in total migrant stocks by country of destination and country of origin. It consolidates all available data on migrant stocks, making it readily accessible for analysis and evaluation. This application aims to assist in developing methodologies for estimating trends in migrant stocks and flows, as well as evaluating the accuracy, comparability, and timeliness of the available empirical data and estimates. Currently, it is the only app that provides access to all empirical evidence for all countries, along with the most recent estimates from the UN Population Division (UNPD) and the World Bank (WB).
